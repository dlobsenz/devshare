- âœ… **VS Code extension** (client interface with WebSocket communication)
- âœ… **Comprehensive build pipeline** with TypeScript compilation

## ðŸ”§ Technical Achievements

### **Intelligent Project Detection**
```yaml
# Example auto-generated manifest
name: sample-react-app
version: 2.1.0
language: node
run: npm run dev
engines:
  node: ">=18.0.0"
ports:
  - 3000
env:
  - NODE_ENV
  - PORT
secrets:
  - API_KEY
  - DATABASE_URL
```

### **Production-Quality Features**
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive try/catch with user-friendly messages
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage with shared contracts
- **Streaming Architecture**: Memory-efficient processing for large projects
- **Process Isolation**: Secure execution with limited permissions
